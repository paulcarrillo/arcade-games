## Instructions
The point of the game is survival while collecting as many gems as possible. You the player start within the bounds of the safe grass. In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).

The goal of the player is to collect as many gems as possible, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player loses all five lives the game is over.

It won't be that easy since there is a constant stream of beetles willing to run you over. You have five lives to try and collect as many gems as possible. Good Luck!


## How to play
The game is simple, use the arrow keys to move the character up, down, left, and right within the game board.

To collect a gem all you have to do is pass over and the gem and it will be collected. The grass is the only place where the character is safe from the enemies. If an Enemy hits the Player you will be reset to the grass and you can continue again collecting gems until you are out of lives.
